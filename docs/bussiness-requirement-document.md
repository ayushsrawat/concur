# Business Requirements Document (BRD): Real-Time Order Processing System

## 1. **Project Overview**
### 1.1 **Introduction**
The Real-Time Order Processing System is designed to handle multiple user orders simultaneously while ensuring data consistency, concurrency management, and real-time transaction processing. The system will be built using **Spring Boot** and **PostgreSQL**, with an emphasis on **high concurrency** and **fault tolerance**.

### 1.2 **Objectives**
- Enable **real-time** order placement and processing.
- Ensure **data consistency** when handling concurrent orders.
- Implement **secure** and **scalable** transaction management.
- Optimize performance using **asynchronous processing**.
- Implement **logging, monitoring, and fault recovery** mechanisms.

---

## 2. **Business Requirements**

### 2.1 **User Authentication & Authorization**
#### **Requirement:**
Users must be able to **register**, **log in**, and **place orders** securely.

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**
- Implement **Spring Security with JWT-based authentication**.
- Users should have roles (e.g., **Customer, Admin**).
- Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive operations.

---

### 2.2 **Order Placement & Processing**
#### **Requirement:**
Users should be able to place an order for products, and the system should handle **concurrent orders safely**.

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system must **validate stock availability** before confirming an order.
- **Prevent race conditions** using **optimistic/pessimistic locking**.
- Process orders using **multi-threading or asynchronous execution**.
- Orders should transition through states (**Pending, Confirmed, Shipped, Delivered**).

---

### 2.3 **Inventory Management**
#### **Requirement:**
Inventory levels must be updated **accurately** and **atomically** to prevent overselling.

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**
- The stock count should be decremented **only after successful order confirmation**.
- Use **transaction management** to prevent inconsistent inventory states.
- Implement **database-level locks** or **versioning mechanisms** for concurrency control.

---

### 2.4 **Payment Handling (Simulated)**
#### **Requirement:**
Payments must be processed in real-time, ensuring **atomic transactions**.

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**
- Simulate payment processing with **event-driven architecture (Kafka/RabbitMQ)**.
- Use **asynchronous processing (CompletableFuture)** to handle payments.
- Ensure payments and orders are processed **atomically**.

---

### 2.5 **Order Status Updates & Notifications**
#### **Requirement:**
Users must be able to track their orders in real-time.

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**
- Implement **WebSockets or push notifications** for live order updates.
- Users should receive an **email/SMS** when their order status changes.
- Maintain an **audit log** for order history tracking.

---

### 2.6 **Concurrency & Scalability**
#### **Requirement:**
The system must support a **high number of concurrent orders** without performance degradation.

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**
- Use **thread-safe mechanisms** for handling shared resources.
- Implement **database connection pooling** (e.g., HikariCP) for efficiency.
- Use **load balancing** to distribute requests across multiple instances.

---

### 2.7 **Database Management (PostgreSQL)**
#### **Requirement:**
Use a **reliable** and **scalable** database to store orders, users, and product inventory.

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**
- Use **normalized schemas** for efficient data storage.
- Implement **indexing and query optimization** for performance.
- Ensure **data integrity** using ACID-compliant transactions.

---

### 2.8 **Logging & Monitoring**
#### **Requirement:**
The system must have **detailed logging** and **real-time monitoring** to track system performance and errors.

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**
- Implement **structured logging** using Log4j or SLF4J.
- Integrate **Prometheus + Grafana** for real-time system monitoring.
- Provide **error handling & retry mechanisms** for failed transactions.

---

### 2.9 **Reliability & Fault Tolerance**
#### **Requirement:**
The system should be resilient to failures and ensure that orders are **never lost**.

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**
- Implement **retry logic** for failed operations.
- Ensure **message queues** handle **order processing asynchronously**.
- Provide **database backups & failover strategies**.

## 3. **Technical Considerations**

### 3.1 **Technology Stack**
| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Backend | Spring Boot |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| Authentication | Spring Security + JWT |
| Concurrency | ExecutorService, CompletableFuture, ForkJoinPool |
| Event Processing | Kafka / RabbitMQ (Optional) |
| Caching | Redis (Optional) |
| Logging | Log4j / SLF4J |
| Monitoring | Prometheus + Grafana |

---

### 3.2 **System Architecture Overview**
1. **User places an order** via REST API.
2. **Order validation and inventory check** happen concurrently.
3. **Stock is updated** atomically in PostgreSQL.
4. **Payment is processed asynchronously**.
5. **Order status updates** are pushed to users in real-time.
6. **Logs and metrics** are stored for monitoring.

---

## 4. **Next Steps**
1. Finalize the database schema design.
2. Set up a basic Spring Boot project structure.
3. Implement API endpoints for order processing.
4. Test concurrency handling and fault tolerance mechanisms.
